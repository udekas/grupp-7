        <p class="costs_text2">There is not an officially confirmed budget for Gran Turismo, but the movie is estimated to have cost about $100 million for Sony to make. This factors in everything from production to the salaries for Gran Turismo's cast. The $100M budget might sound high, but itâ€™s a believable figure for the racing movie.Using so many practical cars to film the races would not be cheap, while Blomkamp also filmed the movie in multiple countries around the world. Add in the costs of doing the various CG work required for the movie, and $100M sounds right for how much Gran Turismo cost to make.
            <br>
            <br>
            The movie has grossed $117+ million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Blomkamp's direction and racing sequences,
            but criticized its writing.
